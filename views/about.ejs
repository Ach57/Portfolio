                                 I'm <strong>Achraf</strong>! I'm a passionate Data science student at Concordia University. Iâ€™m driven by my love for coding and problem-solving, and I'm always looking to dive deeper into the world of technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I have experience with various programming languages, including <strong>Java, Python, C, R and JavaScript</strong>, and I enjoy creating projects that push me to learn something new. My journey so far has included building web applications, process automation tools and even a few personal projects like task management systems.
                            </p>

                            Iâ€™m very dedicated to my fitnessâ€”working out five days a week keeps me energized and helps me stay focused. I love meal prepping, especially simple and nutritious meals that fuel my body and mind.<br><br>

                    Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve both mentally and physically. I believe in taking a proactive approach to life, whether itâ€™s learning new programming skills, managing tasks, or making sure I take care of myself. I'm someone who enjoys working on projectsâ€”whether itâ€™s creating web apps, exploring new technologies, or solving problems. In my personal life, Iâ€™m straightforward and strive to maintain a balance between fun and responsibility.<br><br>

                In my free time, I cherish quality moments with friends and family, enjoy some good food, or unwind while diving into new tech. I believe in continuous growthâ€”whether itâ€™s through work, personal habits, or experiencesâ€”and I'm excited for what the future holds!
